# Cars

This is an uncompleted OOP introduction task, that didn't make it 
to the final version of the course. The task was to create a class
that represents a car and has methods to drive, refuel and get the
current fuel level. The car has a fuel tank with a maximum capacity
and a fuel consumption rate. The car also has a distance driven
counter.
